# rm-musictheory-coreapi
Music Theory (API) - NodeJS App

This is an application that allows users to query information about musical keys, interval, chords and scales.

This is the API for the application that runs as a NodeJS server on localhost:8080 and provides the core music theory functions.

This is intended to be used in conjunction with the Interface contained in https://github.com/Rodney7700/rm-musictheory-interface.git
